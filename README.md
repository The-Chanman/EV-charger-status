# nomad-supply-chain-demo
This is a demo to envision how nomad could provide additional meaning to the entire supply chain. 

This demo will be using 3 different particles that each have triggers. There is are nomad atomic nodes for each of the devices. There is a atomic node that takes the input from from sensors on a particle and then publishes it.
